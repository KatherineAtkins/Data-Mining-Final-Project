# Data-Mining-Final-Project
Collaborative final project; Katherine Atkins, Miryam Ochoa, and Elvira Rodriguez


This project focuses on using data exploration techniques learned in class to analyze pesticide data reported by 35 European Union countries.

Techniques include data understanding, preprocessing, unsupervised machine learning, and post-processes. This project is coupled with a PDF presenting significant data.


DISCLAIMER: For some reason, GitHub won't let me upload manually or push the dataset used for this project claiming 1.3 MB is "too big" (even though the notebook was 2.6 MB and it worked just fine, but whatever...); to accomodate, the link to access the dataset is available in the script in the same kernel as uploading the data.

Please reach out if you have any questions.
